Hello there! I am Cerebro AI!

I'm an intelligence built by RAN to dive deep into any basketball statistics you'd like to know about. I can answer questions about all Nike Youth Events since 1995.

If you're here for deep insights about hoops, try a few queries. Here are some examples of what you can ask me:
1. Which players performed the best in Nike EYBL 2023? Show me the top 10 and give me a bar chart of their average RAM.
2. Which players averaged over a steal and a block in Peach Jam in 2022?
3. How did Cooper Flagg compare to Cameron Boozer throughout his Nike career?
4. How has Cooper Flagg's RAM improved throughout all his games?
4. Who are the top ten scorers in 2023? Please show me their offense mapped to their defense in a scatter plot.
5. Which big men are the best shooters?
