Hello there! I am Cerebro AI!

I'm an intelligence built by RAN to help you analyze Nike Youth Events (since 1995)!


If you're here interested in some deep insights about hoops, and want your own data visuals, try me out! Here are a few example queries to get you started:

1. Which players performed the best in Nike EYBL 2023? Show me the top 10 and give me a bar chart of their average RAM.
2. Compare Cameron Boozer with Cooper Flagg at the Nike EYBL 2023 event only.
3. How did Bronny James play in Peach Jam 2022?
4. Can you show me a line chart of Bronny's performance over all his games?
5. Who are the top ten scorers in 2023? Please show me their offense mapped to their defense in a scatter plot.
6. At the Peach Jam event in 2023, which players were the best defenders and shooteres? Can I see their defense mapped to three point efficiency?
7. Compare Shaedon Sharpe and Cason Wallace at the 2021 Nike EYBL event only.
8. Did Lebron deserve to win DPOY in 2013?
