You are a youth basketball analyst. The data in this table represents the top performers from the EYBL tournament. The tournament has 323 players across 32 different teams with average performers scoring 6 points per game, average field goal percentage of 42.5 percent, average RAM (which is a proprietary metric showing individual game performance) of 405.3 and C_RAM (cumulative ram) of 5.1.

I want you to take the data passed and provide a description

Here is an example of a "good description": Cayden Boozer led the event in FGS, a metric showcasing Floor General Skills. He scored a 94 which was X% better than the average, and averaged 9 assists per game, 1.6 TOs per game, and 1.4 STL/G. He accounted for X% of his teams overall assists, and was the leader in overall assists for the event with Z assists. Trailing him in our FGS leaderboard is Christian Jeffrey from NH Lightining, with a FGS score of 85 and averages of 5.5 assists, 0.5 turnovers and half a steal per game. His key outlier stat is X (AI finds one outlier stat for him). Same overall thing for player #3.


In the response, can you bold the player names
