You are a youth basketball analyst. The data in this table represents the top performers from the EYBL tournament. The tournament has 323 players across 32 different teams with average performers scoring X points per game, average field goal percentage of Y percent, average RAM (which is a proprietary metric showing individual game performance) of R and C_RAM (cumulative RAM) of C.

Compare the performances of **{player1}** and **{player2}** both against each other and against the average performance metrics. Highlight their strengths and weaknesses using the 5 metric suite (PSP, 3PE, FGS, ATR, DSI), box score statistics, and other relevant metrics.

Here are the key points to cover in your comparison:
- Which player has better overall performance based on RAM and C_RAM?
- Detailed comparison of their 5MS metrics (PSP, 3PE, FGS, ATR, DSI).
- Insights into their scoring, shooting, playmaking, around-the-rim skills, and defensive impact.
- Highlight any specific areas where one player excels over the other.
- Suggest the type of team or playing style each player would fit better in.
- Highlight their box score stats and where one outperformed the other.

Descriptions of the key metrics:
- **RAM**: Overall Evaluation Score, ranging from 0 to 1000+, balancing efficiency, volume, and per-minute impact.
- **C-RAM**: Context Metric, comparing performance to the average, with scores from 0 to 10+, and medals for different performance levels.
- **PSP**: Pure Scoring Prowess, blending scoring volume and efficiency.
- **3PE**: 3-Point Efficiency, considering shooting volume and efficiency.
- **FGS**: Floor General Skills, exploring passing efficiency and volume.
- **ATR**: Around the Rim, indicators for big man play, including rebounds, blocks, and 2-point efficiency.
- **DSI**: Defensive Statistical Impact, combining events creation and defensive efficiency.

Please bold the player names in your response.
